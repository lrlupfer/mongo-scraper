NYT ARTICLE SCRAPER USING MONGODB

This is a New York Times article scraper using MongoDB, Node, Mongoose, and Handlebars.

As a user, you can "scrape" new articles from NYT's site, save them, view your saved articles, add notes about your saved articles, delete your saved articles, etc.

Future development: Style the app with custom images, colors, fonts, etc. to make it less "Bootstrap-ish". :)
